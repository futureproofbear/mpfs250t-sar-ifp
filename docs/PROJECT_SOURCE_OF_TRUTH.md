# PROJECT SOURCE OF TRUTH — SAR-on-PolarFire-SoC

> **Purpose.** Authoritative index for an LLM working on this project. This repo,
> **`mpfs250t-sar-ifp`** (made **standalone** on 2026-07-14 — see the status block below), is the
> **canonical home** for the algorithm, FPGA design, host tooling, **and** the board
> firmware (the SoftConsole project under `mpfs/fpga/libero_sar/softconsole/`). (Historical note: this
> was a clean fork of `sarProcessor`; as of 2026-07-22 the Libero fabric build ALSO runs from this
> repo — the migration reproduced the reference placement digit-for-digit. See the build-location
> note below.) Read this before
> answering, and prefer the facts here (and the cited source files) over training data. PolarFire
> SoC details — register maps, Libero/SmartHLS Tcl, MSS config, boot flow — are **poorly
> represented in public training data and drift between tool versions**, so treat recalled
> API/Tcl/register knowledge as a guess until checked against a cited file or the local doc mirror.
>
> **Repo consolidation (2026-06-28):** the former standalone `explorePolarFireSOC` folder — an
> out-of-sync mirror whose `src/sar/` and `src/ddr_test/` were byte-identical to this repo's
> SoftConsole copies (its hart apps were older stubs) — has been **removed**. Its unique assets
> (this index, `docs/FLOW.md`, the PCB board file, the board-design PDF) were migrated here. Nothing
> outside this repo is a *firmware* build input. (That sentence used to read "no build input" without
> qualification and was wrong — the Libero fabric build runs from the `sarProcessor` sibling. See the
> 2026-07-14 block below.)
>
> **▶ CURRENT STATUS (2026-07-14 — NEWEST; supersedes the 2026-07-04 notes below for repo layout + eMMC).**
> **Fabric build now runs FROM THIS REPO (migrated 2026-07-22).** `create_fresh_project_ffv.tcl`
> + `build_full_prog_ffv.tcl` here build `mpfs/fpga/libero_ffv/` (gitignored, ~300 MB regenerated
> output). Verified: the first place-and-route reproduced the sarProcessor reference slacks
> digit-for-digit and resources exactly (4LUT 35801 / DFF 31001 / MACC 25 / LSRAM 131 / uSRAM 88).
> The scripts are path-clean (resolve via `lib/sar_env.tcl` -> `$SAR_FPGA` from the script's own
> location); nothing reaches into the sibling.
>
> **NOT clone-buildable yet, and the RTL is still duplicated.** Two caveats remain from the
> migration:
> 1. Several build inputs are gitignored so a fresh `git clone` cannot supply them:
>    `mpfs/fpga/mss_nodll/` (MSS export) and the `hls_output/` trees (absent for corner_turn/detect,
>    stale for window/resample). `shls hw` regenerates the HLS ones, but that step is not yet in the
>    flow. Regenerate them before a first build on a new checkout.
> 2. The 9 `.v` files ALSO still exist in `sarProcessor`, and `feeder_v_core.tcl` /
>    `unloader_v_core.tcl` link `"$here/..."` — their own directory. So a build launched from THIS
>    repo uses THIS repo's RTL (correct), but the sibling's stale copies are a trap if anyone builds
>    there. The real fix is to delete the sarProcessor fabric tree once its bitstream history is no
>    longer needed. Until then: this repo is authoritative for RTL; the sibling is legacy.
> **On-board eMMC pipeline (M1–M3) PROVEN on silicon** — the scene lives on the board eMMC and is loaded +
> focused entirely on-board, retiring the recurring ~3 h JTAG scene load: **M1** bring-up (write→read→CRC);
> **M2** provision a CPHD scene to the INPUT partition (`crcE==crcR==0x58d0ea66`, Centerfield 97.6 MB); **M3**
> boot-load eMMC→DDR (81.5 s; 10 segments → role addresses + JOB reconstruct), run `sar_form_image` end-to-end
> (**SAR_SEQ_OK**, no stage timeout), confirm a coherent focused SAR image via an ROI crop, and persist the
> output to the eMMC OUTPUT partition (commit-last, crash-safe). LOAD/PIPE/crop proven; the commit-last
> SAVEOUT + a VERIFY_OUT command are built and await a reflash + re-run next board session. eMMC read
> ~1.5 MB/s (scene load 81.5 s), write ~0.13 MB/s; **host↔PC dump is still ~3 h** (FlashPro6 JTAG ~9 KB/s is
> the bottleneck, not the eMMC) — verify via small ROI crops.
> **FFT engine (corrected):** the range/azimuth FFTs run on the **fabric CoreFFT** chain
> (`fft_feeder → gearbox → CoreFFT → fft_unloader`), selected at runtime by **`SAR_FFTMODE`
> @`0xB0059110` = 1**, which the pipeline flow scripts (`flow_pipe_*.gdb`) set before PIPE. CPU
> `sar_cpu_fft` (`src/sar/sar_fft.c`, mode 0) is the **legacy fallback** — the 2026-07-04 note below that
> calls the FFT a CPU path is superseded. The 2026-07-20 board run confirmed `fft_mode=1` (fabric CoreFFT)

> **Pipeline total: 48.19 s** (measured 2026-07-22, azimuth-gather-fused build). Window AND detect
> are now fused into the FFT passes; no CPU stage remains in the datapath.
> How it got here: 110.8 s -> 88.1 s (targeted CCACHE `FLUSH64` writeback of the coefficient banks
> replacing a per-line whole-L2 flush) -> 79.79 s (2-D Hamming window fused into the range-FFT
> feeder, deleting a 512 MB-read + 512 MB-write pass) -> ~78.6 s (resample coefficient closed form)
> -> 58.12 s (magnitude detect fused into the azimuth-FFT unloader, deleting a 512 MB-read +
> 128 MB-write pass AND halving that pass's write traffic)
> -> 48.19 s (azimuth resample gather fused into the FFT-1 feeder, deleting its DDR round-trip;
> resample 27.19 -> 13.46 s).
> **The CRC gate no longer applies.** ROI crc `0xd596c9eb` held from the 110.8 s build through the
> window fusion, but the coefficient rewrite and the detect fusion change values deliberately (both
> are MORE accurate). Correctness is now gated by an A/B against the known-good CPU detect on

> **Largest remaining target after the azimuth-gather fusion: the FFT-1 feeder at 15.97 s** (resample,
> the range gather, is now 13.46 s -- was 26.92 s). The shipping gather kernel schedules

## 0. Anti-hallucination rules (read first)

1. **Never invent a register offset, DDR address, AXI signal, HAL function signature, or Libero
   Tcl command.** Quote it from a file in §3–§6, or say it must be verified.
2. **To write a driver/peripheral app, open the actual HAL header** (paths in §5) and base the
   code *strictly* on the functions/signatures there. Do not assume an API exists.
3. **Two SAR register-map models coexist in the tree — do not mix them.** See §4.3. The hardware
   that is actually built uses the **per-kernel SmartHLS model** (`sar_kernels.h`), *not* the
   monolithic `sar_accel_driver.h` model.
4. **Libero/SmartHLS Tcl is version-locked to 2025.2 here.** Cross-check every Tcl command
   against the Microchip command reference; several SmartDesign APIs that "should" exist fail in
   this version (see §7). Be skeptical of LLM-generated Tcl.
5. **Templates ≠ working hardware.** Much of `mpfs/fpga` is unsynthesized template / spec code.
   §8 lists what is actually verified on silicon vs. what is aspirational.
6. **Environment constraints:** Windows 11; **no PowerShell** (forbidden + GPO-blocked — use
   `cmd`/git-bash, avoid `wmic`/`winget`); JTAG is the only board I/O path. See memory notes (§9).
7. **The canonical (and only) firmware is the SoftConsole project in THIS repo** (§6). There is no
   external `explorePolarFireSOC` copy — that folder has been removed; do not cite it.

## 1. Repo layout (this repo + the vendor reference)

| Repo | Path | Role | Git |
|---|---|---|---|
| **mpfs250t-sar-ifp** (this) | `…\github\mpfs250t-sar-ifp` | **Canonical** for firmware, host tooling and docs. Python golden pipeline (`src/`), host JTAG tools (`mpfs/host/`), FPGA design + HLS kernels (`mpfs/fpga/`), and the board firmware (SoftConsole project under `mpfs/fpga/libero_sar/softconsole/`). | git → `github.com/futureproofbear/mpfs250t-sar-ifp` (LFS) |
| sarProcessor | `…\github\sarProcessor` | **Retired as canonical**, but the Libero projects and exported bitstreams historically live here (`libero_ffv/export/SAR_TOP_ffv.job`). | git (LFS) |
| **polarfire-soc** | `…\github\polarfire-soc` | **Vendor reference (the "Software Index" + "Driver Layer").** Doc mirror, HSS source, bare-metal HAL library, examples, Icicle reference design. Read-only — cite, don't edit. | vendor clone |
| orbitDesign | `…\github\orbitDesign` | **Unrelated** (orbital-mechanics study). Ignore unless explicitly asked. | — |

## 2. Architecture map (the hardware, fixed facts)

> **AMBA / interconnect architecture (definitive):** [`fpga/AMBA_ARCHITECTURE.md`](fpga/AMBA_ARCHITECTURE.md)
> — DIC (data) / CIC (control) interconnect topology, masters/slaves, address map, clocking & reset,
> FFT stream path, the ID converter, and the AXI4-Lite `TARGET_TYPE` rule. Conventions that prevent the
> silent-integration failures: [`fpga/FABRIC_INTERCONNECT_CONVENTIONS.md`](fpga/FABRIC_INTERCONNECT_CONVENTIONS.md).

- **Device:** Microchip **PolarFire SoC MPFS250T_ES** (engineering sample, FCVG484), Icicle Kit.
- **Cores:** **1× E51** monitor hart (hart0 — boot/HSS/control) + **4× U54** application harts
  (hart1–4, each with FPU). In this project: E51 = monitor/wake; **U54_1 = the app/orchestration
  hart**; U54_2–4 are parked WFI stubs.
- **Boot:** **boot mode 1** (MSS harts run non-secure code from **eNVM @ `0x20220000`**, copied to
  **L2 scratchpad `0x0a000000`**). Reset vectors come from `U_MSS_BOOTCFG` in pNVM. Default clock
  80 MHz SCB until MSS clock config. (Boot mode 0 = WFI-halt, used for JTAG debug — see memory
  `mpfs-boot-mode-0-for-debug`.) Ref: `polarfire-soc-documentation-master/knowledge-base/boot-modes/`.
- **I/O constraint:** **JTAG only** (no Ethernet / SD / fast UART). Bulk data moves DDR↔host over
  JTAG; this is slow (**measured ~84 kbit/s ≈ 111 s/MB**; 97 MB ≈ ~2.7 hr) but **reliable when run to
  completion** — the FlashPro6 HID wedges only when a transfer is *killed/interrupted* mid-stream, not
  inherently on sustained traffic (see §7).
- **Partition:** host PC (Python) does parse/geometry/coeff-gen/quantize + golden + post; **U54_1**
  orchestrates and runs detect; **FPGA fabric** does the heavy compute
  (resample→window→FFT→corner-turn→FFT). Fabric clock 62.5 MHz, timing MET.

### Crawl / Walk / Run — where THIS project sits
The vendor "Crawl(Linux)/Walk(bare-metal+AMP)/Run(fabric accel)" ladder applies, but **this project
is squarely in the "Run" tier and deliberately skips Linux.** There is **no Linux, no `/dev/spidev`,
no sysfs** here — it is bare-metal + custom AXI fabric. So:
- Do **not** suggest Linux/UIO/CMA/devicetree solutions for the board runtime (they appear in the
  vendor docs and the *original* `sarProcessor` plan, but were dropped — JTAG-only, no boot medium).
- "Run-tier" prompting applies: generate Verilog/AXI state machines with **explicit interface
  constraints**, and pass data CPU↔fabric over the AXI bus (FIC0). Fabric register/AXI facts in §4.

## 4. Ground-truth constants (quote, don't invent)

> Canonical firmware path (abbreviated below as **`<SC>/`**):
> `mpfs/fpga/libero_sar/softconsole/mpfs-hal-ddr-demo/src/`

### 4.1 DDR memory map — SAR buffers
Source: `<SC>/sar/ddr_sar_layout.h` (mirrors `mpfs/host/ddr_layout.py`).

| Symbol | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| app/heap/stack | `0x80000000` (+128 MB) | |
| `SAR_SIG_ADDR` | `0x88000000` (+256 MB) | input I/Q (complex int16) |
| `SAR_SCRATCH_ADDR` | `0x98000000` (+256 MB) | inter-stage |
| `SAR_OUT_ADDR` | `0xA8000000` (+128 MB) | detected magnitude out |
| `SAR_TABLES_BASE` | `0xB0000000` (+16 MB) | KR/KC/TANPHI/WIN/JOB; geometry at +0x100000; coeffs at +0x148000 |
| `SAR_JOB_ADDR` | `0xB0040000` | `sar_job_t`, 96 B, magic `0x53415231`='SAR1' |

### 4.2 ⚠ DDR cache-window discrepancy (VERIFY against MSS config — do not assert)
Source: `<SC>/ddr_test/ddr_packet_test.h` gives the **standard Icicle MSS map**:
`CACHED_32 = 0x80000000` (1 GiB, → `0xBFFFFFFF`), `NONCACHED_32 = 0xC0000000`,
`NONCACHED_WCB_32 = 0xD0000000`, `CACHED_64 = 0x10_00000000`, `NONCACHED_64 = 0x14_00000000`.
**Implication:** by that map, **all** SAR buffers including `TABLES_BASE 0xB0000000` fall in the
**cached** 32-bit window — i.e. the SAR_BRINGUP_REPORT / memory note calling `0xB0…` "non-cached"
is **inconsistent** with the code unless the SAR build customized DDR segmentation in
`mpfs/fpga/mss_*/ICICLE_MSS.cfg`. **Action when this matters:** confirm the actual cached/non-cached
boundary in the MSS configurator before relying on it; it determines whether fabric reads need
L2-coherency handling (see SAR_BRINGUP_REPORT §9.2) for *all* buffers, not some.

### 4.3 ⚠ TWO SAR register-map models — use the per-kernel one
- **REAL / built (use this):** per-kernel SmartHLS model — `<SC>/sar/sar_kernels.h` +
  `<SC>/sar/sar_sequencer.c`. Six AXI4-Lite slaves on **MSS FIC0 @ `0x60000000`**, 4 KiB each:
  `K_CORNER_TURN 0x60000000`(SLAVE0), `K_WINDOW 0x60001000`(1), `K_DETECT 0x60002000`(2),
  `K_RESAMPLE 0x60003000`(3), `K_FFT_FEEDER 0x60004000`(4), `K_FFT_UNLOADER 0x60005000`(5 — the
  `CoreAXI4DMAController` that used to own this window was removed). Per kernel: `HLS_START 0x08` (write 1 = start; read 0 = done),
  `HLS_ARG0 0x0c`, `ARG1 0x10`, `ARG2 0x14`, `ARG3 0x18`.
- **LEGACY / aspirational (do NOT assume on hardware):** monolithic accelerator model —
  `<SC>/sar/sar_accel_driver.h` with a single block at `SAR_ACCEL_BASE 0x60000000`,
  `CTRL 0x00`/`STATUS 0x04`/`BFP_SHIFT 0x1C`/`*_ADDR 0x20…0x50`. This is an earlier single-IP design
  that the SmartHLS multi-kernel build superseded. Mixing the two = hallucination.

### 4.4 Other verified constants
- Job descriptor `sar_job_t`: 96 B, magic `0x53415231` ('SAR1'). Fields M,N,fft_r,fft_a,out_dtype,
  bfp_in_exp,sig_len,sig_crc + 7×uint64 addrs. (`<SC>/sar/ddr_sar_layout.h`)
- CRC: reflected IEEE-802.3, poly `0xEDB88320` (matches host zlib.crc32). (`<SC>/ddr_test/ddr_packet_test.c`)
- DDR test packet: magic `0xDEADBEEF`, 256 B payload, 272 B total. (`<SC>/ddr_test/ddr_packet_test.h`)
- Fixed SAR grid: **8192×8192**; frame 256 MiB (int16 I/Q), out 128 MiB (uint16). (`<SC>/sar/sar_sequencer.c`)
- Speed of light in coeff gen: `299792458.0f`. (`<SC>/sar/sar_resample_coeffs.h`)
- M2 harness result table @ `0xB0050000`, done sentinel `g_m2_done = 0xC0FFEE02`. (`<SC>/application/hart1/u54_1.c`)
- Fabric clock net `CCC_OUT0_FABCLK_0` (from 160 MHz OSC via PF_CCC); reset `RST_FABRIC_RESET_N`.

### 4.5 On-target CRC32 verify mailbox (replaces slow dump+cmp readback)
Source: `<SC>/application/hart1/u54_1.c`. Host writes a **6×u32 mailbox at DDR `0xB0058000`**:
`+0 cmd`, `+4 base`, `+8 len`, `+C result`, `+10 status`, `+14 seq`. To verify a region: write
`cmd=0x43524333` ('CRC3'), `base`, `len`; **resume hart1**. Firmware computes a zlib-compatible CRC32
(reflected IEEE-802.3, poly `0xEDB88320`) over `[base, base+len)` at DDR speed (~75 MB/s), writes
`result` and `status=0xC0FFEE03`. Host then halts and reads back the 4-byte result. This makes a
97 MB verify take **seconds vs ~2.7 hr** for a dump+cmp. Host tool: `mpfs/host/run_crc_verify.sh
FILE [BASE_HEX]`. Validated on silicon: `sig_head.bin` (1 MB) = `0x24775359`, `sigchunk_00` (8 MB)
= `0x591213fe` — both match host `zlib.crc32`.

**The firmware's own HAL copy** (what the build actually compiles against — keep edits in sync with
this, not the vendor tree): `mpfs/fpga/libero_sar/softconsole/mpfs-hal-ddr-demo/src/platform/{mpfs_hal,hal,drivers\mss}\`

> **Prompting pattern (from the user's framework):** *"Bare-metal app for the PolarFire SoC U54.
> Here is the HAL header [paste `mss_<peripheral>.h`]. Based strictly on these functions, write …"*
> Always paste the real header so signatures are exact.

## 6. Key engineering files & docs by area (the working set)

### Board firmware — SoftConsole project (CANONICAL)
Root: `mpfs/fpga/libero_sar/softconsole/mpfs-hal-ddr-demo/src/` (= `<SC>/`)
- `<SC>/application/hart0/e51.c` — monitor / wake. `hart1/u54_1.c` — **the M2 autonomous harness**

## 7. ⚠ Tooling & version warnings

- **Toolchain (version-locked):** Libero SoC **2025.2** + SmartHLS; SoftConsole
  `v2022.2-RISC-V-747`; **new** OpenOCD 0.12 (`github.com/microchip-fpga/openocd`, driver
  `microchip-efp6`); FlashPro Express 2025.2; `mpfsBootmodeProgrammer.jar` + `fpgenprog` for
  eNVM/boot mode. Binaries under `C:\Microchip\Libero_SoC_2025.2\Libero_SoC\Designer\bin\`.
- **Libero Tcl skepticism (the user's explicit warning, confirmed here):** tool-specific Tcl
  changes between versions and is sparse in training data. In 2025.2 the SmartDesign insertion
  APIs `create_hdl_core`, `sd_instantiate_hdl_module/_core`, `sd_disconnect_pins` **fail**;
  `sd_connect_pins` works but can't remove a slice. IP *reconfigure* (`delete_component` +
  `create_and_configure_core` + `generate_component -component_name` + `run_tool`) **does** work.
  Always cross-check generated Tcl against the Microchip command reference; prefer the GUI for
  SmartDesign edits (see `docs/fpga/history/idconv_gui_steps.md`).
- **JTAG transfer speed & HID behaviour (measured 2026-06-30):** bulk DDR load over JTAG is
  **latency-bound, not bandwidth-bound** — ~390 µs per JTAG word-scan through the embedded FlashPro6
  USB-HID gives a measured **~84 kbit/s (~111 s/MB, ~10 kB/s)**, identical at 2 MHz and 6 MHz and for
  `sysbus` vs `progbuf`; no OpenOCD batching knob exists. A transfer that **runs to completion is clean
  and byte-exact** (1 MB and 8 MB loads verified MD5-identical to source). The FlashPro6 HID **wedges
  only when openocd is killed mid-transfer** (e.g. a too-short timeout) **or when a `verify_image`
  byte-by-byte readback is interrupted**; recovery = physically re-plug the J33 USB. So bulk JTAG is
  *slow but viable* (97 MB ≈ ~2.7 hr if never killed), **not** an inherent "crashes on sustained
  traffic" failure. The autonomous-firmware pattern (M2 harness; on-target CRC §4.5) is still preferred
  because it avoids the slow readback, not because the transfer is unsafe.
- **JTAG clock ceiling:** stable speed = **6 MHz**. `adapter speed 15000` **corrupts the debug module**
  (dmstatus reads bogus "version 4" `0x1e1904`, harts go unavailable/reset). **Never use >6 MHz** on
  this board/cable.

## 8. What is verified vs. template (don't overclaim)

**Verified / working (on silicon):**
- Off-board PFA pipeline (Python golden), correlation ≈ 0.9999998.
- ES bitstream builds, timing met. Boot mode 1 firmware runs end-to-end on silicon.
- **Control plane:** U54_1 wakes, runs the autonomous M2 harness, FIC0→AXI4-Lite to all 5 kernels
  decodes; AXI4-Lite write/read-back exact (kernel clocks alive).
- **DATA plane (FIXED 2026-06-29):** fabric AXI-master DDR read/write works. Root cause was **AXI
  ID-width truncation at `FIC_0_AXI4_S`** (not the address-tie co-suspect); fix = `sar_axi_idconv.v`
  (ID stash/restore). M2 `tag=0x30` HANG→PASS, SCRATCH written.
- **DMA control slave (FIXED 2026-06-30):** reads complete — tags `0x50–0x53` read **distinct** DMA
  registers (VER=`0x00020064`), no hang. Root cause = CIC slave-5 was `TARGET_TYPE=0` (Full AXI4)
  feeding the DMA's reduced AXI4-Lite control through a 64→32 DWC, black-holing reads; fix = CIC
  `TARGET5_TYPE=1` (AXI4-Lite) + 11-bit address slice (`sd_create_pin_slices`). **Both interconnects
  upgraded to CoreAXI4Interconnect 3.0.130** (was 2.9.100; DMA = CoreAXI4DMAController 2.2.107, CoreFFT
  8.1.100). Detail: `docs/fpga/history/dma_fix_plan.md` §7g + `docs/fpga/AMBA_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- DDR JTAG loopback + CRC integrity (M0). **Bulk JTAG load integrity proven** (2026-06-30): 1 MB and
  8 MB loads byte-identical to source (`dump_image` + host cmp, MD5 match), and confirmed via the
  on-target CRC32 mailbox (§4.5).

**NOT yet done / open:**

> ⚠ The list below is the 2026-07-01 snapshot and is **superseded** by the status blocks at the top of
> this file: the full PFA pipeline now runs end-to-end on silicon at 62.5 MHz with timing MET
> (79.79 s, corr 0.9923, scene loaded from on-board eMMC in 81.5 s), the DMA has been removed in favour of
> `fft_unloader`, and the fabric CoreFFT path is confirmed at runtime. It is kept for the root-cause

- **M3 full PFA pipeline — root-caused to FPGA timing closure; 62.5 MHz fix PROVEN
  (2026-07-01), bootable bitstream pending.** The full PFA pipeline was wired into firmware
  (PIPE mailbox → `sar_form_image`).
  Stages 1–4 ran on silicon and range-FFT (stage 5) appeared to hang. **Real root cause: the
  bitstream does NOT meet timing at 125 MHz** — P&R `pinslacks.txt` shows 25,847/315,348 pins with
  negative slack (worst −3.7 ns), **all on the single 125 MHz fabric clock** (CT/CIC/DMA/FEED/DIC/RES/
  DET/WIN), while CoreFFT itself has 0 violations — i.e. real same-clock setup failures, not CDC.
  Consequence: non-deterministic silicon; the FFT looped and stages 1–4 only *completed* (completion
  was the only check) — **their data correctness is unverified pending the timing-closed rebuild**.
  This supersedes earlier per-symptom theories. **Fix:** lower fabric-clock CCC OUT0 125→62.5 MHz and
  OUT1 (CoreFFT `SLOWCLK`) 15.625→7.8125 MHz (`SLOWCLK ≤ CLK/8`), headless via
  `PF_CCC_C0_62p5.tcl` + `reconfig_ccc_62p5.tcl` + re-assemble `SAR_TOP` + a **timing-gated build**
  (`build_timed.tcl`, aborts before bitstream on any negative slack). Trade-off: 62.5 MHz halves
  fabric/FIC throughput (fine for bring-up). **Standing lesson:** always verify P&R timing closure
  before blaming logic/firmware — Libero programs timing-failing bitstreams silently, and
  `*_sdc_errors.log` reports SDC *syntax*, not *slack*. **Status (2026-07-01): timing closure PROVEN.**
  Headless P&R of the 62.5 MHz design (with the CoreFFT `CLK`↔`SLOWCLK` false-path `sar_fft_cdc.sdc`)
  **closes timing completely — 0 setup violations of 315,349 pins and 0 hold** (vs 25,847 setup
  violations at 125 MHz), validated via the Libero VM-netlist custom flow (`mpfs/fpga/libero_vm`); the
  clock-lowering fix is confirmed. **Caveat:** a fully *bootable* bitstream still needs the SAR_TOP
  SmartDesign rebuilt with the (already regenerated) 62.5 MHz CCC — the PolarFire-SoC MSS is coupled to
  the SmartDesign flow and resists the pure headless netlist flow (verified recipe in
  `docs/fpga/SAR_TOP_RECOVERY.md`). Pending: that bootable rebuild + reprogram + re-run; firmware itself
  is valid (PIPE/CRC mailboxes, DMA external-stream-descriptor, bounded harness).
- **Full DMA *transfer* test** — the DMA *control* plane is verified, but a real descriptor+START
  data-move (CoreFFT stream → DDR S2MM) has not yet been exercised.
- `mpfs/fpga/*.cpp` (`sar_accel_top.cpp`, `fft1d.cpp`) is **unsynthesized template/spec** — the *built*
  design is the per-kernel SmartHLS model (CT/WIN/DET/RES/FEED) + CoreFFT + DMA, not these monoliths.
- Full end-to-end 97 MB full-res load not yet routinely run — but bulk JTAG transfer is **viable, just
  slow** (~84 kbit/s, ~2.7 hr; §7) and **byte-exact when run to completion**, so a USB path is **not a
  hard requirement**. Recommended workflow: **reduced-frame (8 MB) for dev iteration**; a one-time
  chunked background load (run to completion, never killed) + **on-target CRC verify** (§4.5) for the
  full frame.
- Full end-to-end SAR image-formation run on silicon (all stages chained) — pending the above.
